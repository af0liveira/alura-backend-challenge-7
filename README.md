# Jornada Milhas

This project is being developed as part of the **7th Alura Backend Challenge**.
The goal is to develop the API to integrate to the frontend of a travel website,
which displays photos and an enticing information about travel destinations.
Moreover, the site will show statements made by other travellers about the
destination.
